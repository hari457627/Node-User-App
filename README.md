Steps to be followed for running a project

i)    git clone url
ii)   go to the location of file where you have cloned the project
iii)  docker-compose build
iv)   docker-compose up

Then your project is up and will be running on the port 4005.

Note: when ever you have cloned the project, you need to change the ip address in the default.json in the config directory.
